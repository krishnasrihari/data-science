The movie gets dumber and more desperate as it goes.
Little contained in this misfire of a film works and the few successful things are dragged out to the point where they die a lingering death.
Shallow, dimwitted and inept. Makes "The Hangover" look like "Glengarry Glen Ross."
The most important unfinished business here is Steve Conrad's slapdash script, with its shifting tones, forced jokes and gaping plot holes.
At least the three affable stars have an infectious enthusiasm, but that chemistry only goes so far when it's so difficult to find much sympathy for these bumbling losers.
The problem is that this movie shares screen-time with a mid-2000s shock comedy. Hardly five minutes go by without something gross or disgusting happening.
You'll just be rooting for the credits to roll
It seems to have been designed as a family guy's workplace comedy on tour with the boys, a kind of EuroBusinessTrip with a heart: it fails dismally on all counts
Comedies this toothless and safe are a dime a dozen
The crude humor and cloying sentiment mix about as well as motor oil and vinegar
"Unfinished Business" is sloppy, tiresome, poorly constructed and ultimately awful
The movie had a chance to be better, but when the subject turns to something as timely as school bullying, it barely scratches the surface
The three leads balance each other especially well: Vaughn's ironic vulnerability and Wilkinson's pained earnestness set off Franco's shy optimism
Unfinished Business may be the best Judd Apatow comedy that Judd Apatow never made
A tonal mess that jumbles elements of PG-rated fare with Eurotrip-esque shenanigans
It starts with vague promise but rapidly degenerates into a puerile mess, flailing for laughs like a ten-year-old class clown desperate for popularity
Not without charm, Unfinished Business mixes the cute with the raunchy
"Unfinished Business" is a major let-down and proof that even someone of Vince Vaughn's ability and stature needs help behind the camera to make us love him again
Going through the motions and never uncovering any funny material to play with, "Unfinished Business" is just that: a film that had loads of potential but isn't able to muster any laughs with it
A wacky, hijinxy, dick joke-filled sex romp that inadvisably keeps trying to be touching
